# Simple Client Server

This is a simple client server application using the socket library. The server runs on port 5000, the client on 5001. The server accepts command and executes them on the server machine, for example 'ls' returns a directory listing for the local directory the server is running in, or more usefully, 'ls /' lists the root directory contents of the server machine.
